# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
None - tried to stay as "out the box" as possible.
### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

'npm start'

(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
More code re-use, proper database with API request on page load to retrieve data (missed requirement), add test coverage, do more reading to follow proper SASS guidelines and maybe consider using functions as opposed to classes for stateless components. (which seems to be the standard)

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
First time getting my teeth into react - parent component can support any size of dataset in theory, all child components self contained, styling is responsive due to using CSS grid based layout. (it was a good opportunity to learn this)

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Most of my time was spent either getting the components all hooked up or later in the allocated time doing the styling. (CSS isn't my strong suit) I found it most difficult to find the corners to cut in order to meet the deadline but feel I made the right cuts.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
The test was pretty fun - it was closer to a real world business scenario where you are given some AC, a design and told to go at it. Suggestions I would recommend are updating documentation to state that as of right now you need a node v12 environment to get it running off the bat, perhaps have template react components closer to what we see on the official React documentation. (as finding examples for some help if you're new can be hit or miss)
